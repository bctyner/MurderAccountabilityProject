# MurderAccountabilityProject
Data files, scripts, and other documents from the Murder Accountability Project (MAP). 
The murder data include hundreds of thousands of records obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request from the FBI.
The data are being continuously analyzed to develop tools for law enforcement for identifying trends in murders and 
serial killings in the US.

Original MAP project files were posted with permission of Thomas Hargrove from MAP in an effort to promote awareness of 
and contribution to the project.
